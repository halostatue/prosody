# Prosody Changelog

## 1.0.1 / 2026-01-12

- Fix an error with Prosody.Tableau where Tableau configuration wasn't being
  retrieved properly if not provided. This was mostly a testing failure (the
  tests did not properly emulate a Tableau environment).

- Fixed a few issues in various support documents, including simplifying the
  security policy.

## 1.0.0 / 2026-01-06

- Initial release.
